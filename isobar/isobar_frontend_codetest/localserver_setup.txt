You'll need a local web server set up for the code challenge. Setting one up shouldn't be difficult, but you may find the following links useful if you've never set one up before:

MAC:

OSX used to have a 'Web Sharing' feature but it was removed in Mountain Lion. Please see this article for setting up your local server:

Alternitively, if you prefer a GUI, try Anvil: http://anvilformac.com/.

PC:

We recommend using XAMPP as it's a relatively simple install: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html#522
